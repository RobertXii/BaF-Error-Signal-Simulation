# Stark Interference Simulation for BaF Molecules

This repository contains simulation code and logs related to studying systematic error signals (W) in Stark interference measurements using <sup>138</sup>BaF molecules. The project investigates why a linear relationship arises between the extracted W signal and the product of laser detuning and non-reversing (NR) electric field strength.

## Motivation

Experiments using <sup>138</sup>BaF molecules showed unexpected linear behavior between systematic error signals and experimental imperfections. This simulation aims to reproduce and understand that effect in a simplified three-level quantum system.

## Model Overview

The system consists of:
- Two nearly degenerate ground states (odd/even parity)
- One excited state (even parity)
- Time-dependent electric fields (reversing/Stark field, depletion laser L2, and non-reversing)
- Population transfer computed as molecules pass through the interaction region

## Goals

- Reproduce the experimental behavior of W as a function of laser detuning Ã— NR field
- Understand underlying physics causing the systematic linear dependence
